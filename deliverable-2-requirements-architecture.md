# Turbin3 Capstone, Deliverable 2: Atomic Requirements & Architecture Diagram

**Project:** Heirloom, non-custodial digital succession for Solana wallets.
**Team:** Heirloom —  Rohit Rathore. Josh Sandhu

# 1. Scope: Capstone Idea & MVP Use Cases

## 1.1 The idea

Heirloom lets a Solana owner name a beneficiary and a check-in interval. While the owner is alive, **all assets stay in the owner's own wallet** (no vault, no escrow, no shared keypair). If the owner stops checking in, the owner's *pre-authorized* sweep can be completed and broadcast, moving the live SOL balance to the beneficiary.

## 1.2 Core mechanism

- The owner signs, once per check-in cycle, a durable-nonce transaction `[AdvanceNonceAccount, heir_sweep(beneficiary)]`. `heir_sweep` has **no amount argument**; it reads the owner's live lamports at execution time (POC-confirmed).
- **Problem found in the POC:** anyone holding a fully signed copy can submit it early; the failed attempt still advances the nonce and permanently burns the only copy.
- **Adopted fix:** the Heirloom keeper is the nonce authority *and* fee payer, so the transaction is **structurally incomplete** (missing the keeper signature) until the deadline passes. Solana rejects a transaction with a missing signature before any instruction runs, so the nonce can't be burned by a premature replay. The owner-signed partial transaction is safe to store anywhere.

## 1.3 MVP use cases (5, each = 1 state transition = 1 Anchor instruction)

Roadmap items deliberately *out* of MVP: SPL-token distribution, multi-beneficiary splits, in-place beneficiary change (to change heir in MVP: `close_plan` then `initialize_plan`), staged warning instructions, protocol pause/admin config, ZK/privacy, post-trigger market positions. The grace period is folded into the plan as a field (`grace_period`) rather than a separate instruction, and is adjustable through `update_plan` (UC5).

| ID | Use case | Handler | Signer | Atomic state transition |
|----|----------|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| UC1 | Owner creates a succession plan | `initialize_plan` | Owner | No account → `Plan` PDA (owner, beneficiary, keeper, nonce account, interval, grace, `last_checkin = now`, status Active) |
| UC2 | Owner proves liveness | `check_in` | Owner | `plan.last_checkin = Clock now` |
| UC3 | Sweep live SOL to beneficiary after deadline | `heir_sweep` | Owner (presigned earlier) + Keeper (withheld until deadline) | Owner lamports → beneficiary; `plan.status = Distributed` |
| UC4 | Owner cancels the plan and removes the heir | `close_plan` | Owner | `Plan` PDA → closed (rent returned to owner); stored `sweep_tx` is deleted with it. Keeper then burns the nonce (REQ14) |
| UC5 | Owner updates the check-in period | `update_plan` | Owner | `plan.checkin_interval` / `plan.grace_period` replaced, `last_checkin = now` (timer reset), `sweep_tx` overwritten with a freshly signed partial sweep |

*Variant covered by UC1–UC3 with no extra instruction:* "transfer to my own secondary failsafe wallet" is simply `beneficiary = owner's other wallet`.

## 1.3a Your user stories mapped to the MVP (from your Excalidraw notes)

| Your story | Becomes | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 1. User creates the transfer instruction by entering the heir's public key | UC1 `initialize_plan` (`beneficiary`) which also stores the owner-signed partial sweep bytes in the plan (REQ10) | In MVP |
| 2. Transfer a set amount X, with a failover max if the account lacks X | Not in MVP. `heir_sweep` has no amount; it sweeps the live balance, which is the "max" case by construction | Roadmap (fixed amount + failover) |
| 2b. Store the transfer instruction (where?) | On-chain, in the `Plan` PDA (`sweep_tx` bytes). No encryption needed: the transaction is half-signed (keeper signature withheld), so reading it gives nobody the ability to submit it or burn the nonce | Answered: REQ04/REQ10 |
| 3. User sets the dead man's switch period | UC1 `checkin_interval` and `grace_period`; UC2 `check_in` resets it | In MVP |
| 4. Protocol checks whether the nonce burned and re-initiates | Not needed. The keeper is the nonce authority and fee payer, so no third party can advance the nonce. Premature keeper submission is prevented by the REQ11 pre-flight | Not needed |
| 5. At the deadline, the protocol executes the transfer | UC3 `heir_sweep` | In MVP |
| 6. Protocol checks daily which stored instructions are due | Keeper scan (REQ11). Off-chain, not a handler | In MVP (off-chain) |
| Extend: multiple wallets, ZK/ephemeral privacy, buying market positions on trigger | Not in MVP | Roadmap |
| 7. User can cancel the plan and remove the heir after it has been set | UC4 `close_plan`. Closing the `Plan` PDA deletes the stored `sweep_tx`, so nothing remains in storage. The keeper finds no plan and stops tracking it. The keeper then advances and withdraws the nonce account (REQ14), so any stale copy of the bytes can never be valid, regardless of program state (REQ12) | In MVP |
| 8. User can change the check-in / signing period after setup, and the timer resets so the new period starts fresh | UC5 `update_plan` replaces interval and grace, sets `last_checkin = now`, and overwrites `sweep_tx` with a new owner-signed partial sweep (REQ13) | In MVP |

Your noted problem (nonce burned by other parties) is the exact risk the withheld keeper signature addresses.

## 1.4 Actors (LOI categories carried forward)

| Category | Actor | Role in MVP | Signs |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Direct | **Owner** | Creates, updates and cancels the plan, checks in, presigns the sweep each cycle | UC1, UC2, UC4, UC5, and (earlier, offline) the owner half of UC3 |
| Direct | **Keeper** (Heirloom relay) | Reads the stored half-signed sweep from the `Plan` PDA, watches deadline, adds final signature and broadcasts | UC3 (co-signer + fee payer + nonce authority) |
| Beneficiary | **Beneficiary** | Receives SOL passively | Nothing |
| Administrator | *(none on-chain in MVP)* | `ProtocolConfig`/admin pause deferred to roadmap | — |
| Stakeholder | Wallet providers, estate/legal advisors, other legal heirs, auditors | Off-chain interest only | — |

# 2. Granularity Self-Check (team's own pass, before AI)


| Rule | UC1 `initialize_plan` | UC2 `check_in` | UC3 `heir_sweep` |
|------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **1. Atomicity** (exactly one handler) | Pass. Creates one PDA, including the first `sweep_tx`. The nonce account is created beforehand via System Program and is **not** part of this instruction. | Pass. One write: `last_checkin` and the replacement `sweep_tx` together ("refresh liveness and pre-authorization"). Building and signing the bytes is client-side. | Pass **with caveat**: the transaction contains `AdvanceNonceAccount` (System Program) + `heir_sweep` (Heirloom). Only `heir_sweep` is our handler; the nonce advance is a required companion instruction, not a second state transition of ours. |
| **2. State ownership** | Pass. All state in `Plan` PDA (program-owned). | Pass. `Plan` PDA. | Pass. Status in `Plan`; lamports move between System-owned wallets via CPI. |
| **3. Real signers** | Pass. Owner signs. | Pass. Owner signs. | Pass **with caveat**: signers are explicit — owner (signed weeks earlier, offline), keeper (signs at execution). The keeper is a *named, on-record* signer, not a hidden backend; its key is stored in `plan.keeper`. |
| **4. On-chain vs client** | On-chain: PDA creation, validation. Client: nonce account creation, UI. | On-chain: timestamp write. Client: build and sign the fresh partial sweep before sending, reminders. | On-chain: deadline gate, beneficiary check, transfer, status. Client/off-chain: deadline polling and pre-flight simulation. |

**UC4 `close_plan` and UC5 `update_plan`:** both pass all four rules. Each is one handler and one state transition on the `Plan` PDA (close it / rewrite its schedule and `sweep_tx`), owner is the only signer, and signing the replacement partial sweep is client-side. `update_plan` deliberately overlaps with `check_in` (both reset `last_checkin` and overwrite `sweep_tx`) but is kept separate because it also changes `interval` and `grace`, which `check_in` must never do.

**Open issues found in our own pass:**
1. The half-signed transaction is stored on-chain in the `Plan` PDA, unencrypted, because the withheld keeper signature makes the bytes useless to anyone but the keeper. Trade-offs: the PDA needs space for a transaction (max 1,232 bytes) and the bytes are public. Neither blocks the MVP. `initialize_plan` and `check_in` both take the bytes as an argument, so state ownership stays on-chain.
2. Keeper is a single point of liveness and its key has protocol-wide blast radius (execution notes §5). HSM/KMS and N-of-M signer set are post-MVP.
3. Fixed amount with max-failover is **not** in MVP; sweep is live balance only.
4. Nonce authority held by the keeper means the keeper could advance/close the nonce and withhold (DoS), but **cannot redirect funds**, because the beneficiary is inside the owner's signed message and re-checked against `plan.beneficiary`.

# 3. On-Chain Requirements Matrix

## 3.1 Numbered requirements

| REQ | Requirement | Type | Traces to |
|-----|-------------|------|-----------|
| **REQ01** | `initialize_plan`: create `Plan` PDA with owner, beneficiary, keeper, nonce account, interval, grace, `last_checkin`, status = Active | Instruction | UC1 |
| **REQ02** | `check_in`: only `plan.owner` may update `last_checkin` to Clock time, only while status = Active | Instruction | UC2 |
| **REQ03** | `heir_sweep`: transfer owner's live lamports to beneficiary and set status = Distributed | Instruction | UC3 |
| **REQ04** | Plan PDA state layout, including `sweep_tx: Vec<u8>` (owner-signed, keeper-unsigned, unencrypted), and seeds `["plan", owner]` (one plan per owner) | Account | UC1, UC2, UC3 |
| **REQ05** | Durable nonce account created via System Program, **authority = keeper**, holds only rent-exempt balance; pubkey recorded in `plan.nonce_account` | Account / external | UC1, UC3 |
| **REQ06** | Deadline gate: `Clock >= last_checkin + interval + grace` else revert | Constraint | UC3 |
| **REQ07** | Binding checks: `beneficiary == plan.beneficiary`, `owner == plan.owner`, `keeper == plan.keeper` (signer), `nonce == plan.nonce_account` | Constraint | UC3 |
| **REQ08** | Replay guard: `status == Active` required; set `Distributed` after transfer | Constraint | UC3 |
| **REQ09** | CPI `system_program::transfer(owner → beneficiary, owner.lamports())` using the owner's presigned signature | CPI | UC3 |
| **REQ10** | Owner builds and signs a fresh partial `[AdvanceNonceAccount, heir_sweep]` (keeper signature withheld) and passes it as an argument to `initialize_plan` / `check_in`, which overwrite `plan.sweep_tx` | Instruction arg + client | UC1, UC2, UC3 |
| **REQ11** | Off-chain: keeper scans `Plan` PDAs daily, reads `sweep_tx`, verifies state itself, completes signature and broadcasts only after the deadline. A plan that no longer exists (REQ12) triggers the REQ14 nonce burn, then is dropped from the scan, and the keeper re-reads interval/grace each scan so REQ13 changes apply | Keeper | UC3 |
| **REQ12** | `close_plan`: only `plan.owner` may close the `Plan` PDA (`close = owner`), in status Active or Distributed. Rent is returned to owner and `sweep_tx` is deleted with the account. Owner-only on purpose, so cancelling never depends on keeper liveness | Instruction | UC4 |
| **REQ14** | Off-chain: on seeing a closed `Plan`, keeper submits `AdvanceNonceAccount` then `WithdrawNonceAccount` (rent to owner), permanently invalidating every previously signed sweep. Anyone can verify on-chain that the nonce account is gone | Keeper | UC4 |
| **REQ13** | `update_plan`: only `plan.owner`, only while Active; sets new `checkin_interval` and `grace_period` (same bounds as REQ01), sets `last_checkin = Clock now`, overwrites `sweep_tx` | Instruction | UC5 |

## 3.2 Accounts and PDAs

| Account | Owner program | Seeds / address | Mutable | Holds |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| `Plan` PDA | Heirloom | `["plan", owner_pubkey]` | UC2, UC3, UC5; closed by UC4 | `owner`, `beneficiary`, `keeper`, `nonce_account`, `checkin_interval`, `grace_period`, `last_checkin`, `status`, `bump` |
| Nonce account | System Program | Keypair account (not PDA) | By keeper (authority) via `AdvanceNonceAccount` | Durable nonce value; authority = keeper |
| Owner wallet | System Program | Owner keypair | Lamports debited in UC3 | The assets (never moved before trigger) |
| Beneficiary wallet | System Program | Beneficiary pubkey | Lamports credited in UC3 | — |
| Keeper | System Program | Keeper keypair | Pays fees | — |
| Sysvars | Runtime | `Clock`, `RecentBlockhashes` (nonce) | Read-only | — |

## 3.3 Instructions

| Handler | Signers | Accounts | Key validations |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `initialize_plan(beneficiary, keeper, nonce_account, interval, grace, sweep_tx)` | owner | owner, plan (init), nonce_account, system_program | interval/grace > 0 and within bounds; nonce authority == keeper (read via nonce account state); beneficiary != default |
| `check_in(sweep_tx)` | owner | owner, plan (mut) | `has_one = owner`, status Active, `sweep_tx` length within the account's allocated size |
| `heir_sweep()` | owner (presigned), keeper | owner (mut), beneficiary (mut), plan (mut), nonce_account, clock, system_program | REQ06–REQ09 |
| `close_plan()` | owner | owner (mut), plan (mut, `close = owner`) | `has_one = owner`; status Active or Distributed |
| `update_plan(interval, grace, sweep_tx)` | owner | owner, plan (mut) | `has_one = owner`, status Active, interval/grace > 0 and within bounds, `sweep_tx` length within allocated size |

## 3.4 CPI dependencies

- **System Program `transfer`** (from `heir_sweep`), signed by the owner's presigned signature; not a PDA signer.
- **System Program `AdvanceNonceAccount`** (top-level companion instruction in the same transaction, not a CPI from our program). Must be instruction 0.
- `close_plan` uses Anchor's `close` constraint (lamport transfer, no CPI).
- No Token Program CPI in MVP.

# 4. Adversarial Analysis (AI second pass)


| # | AI finding | Rule | Proposed verdict | Reasoning |
|---|-----------|------|------------------|-----------|
| A1 | `heir_sweep` can only be called with `AdvanceNonceAccount` as instruction 0; if the program doesn't check the instruction-sysvar, a caller could omit it and the owner's signature would be consumed in a non-durable transaction. | Atomicity / Real signers | **Caught that we missed.** Accept: add an instructions-sysvar check that ix 0 is `AdvanceNonceAccount` on `plan.nonce_account`. | A signature without nonce binding would only be valid against a recent blockhash, so the practical window is tiny, but the explicit check is cheap and removes ambiguity. `[DECIDE]` |
| A2 | Sweep drains the owner to 0 lamports, so the owner account may become non-rent-exempt or fail if it holds data. | State ownership | **Likely wrong.** System-owned wallets can be fully drained; there's no rent requirement for a zero balance. Only an issue if the wallet holds a token account or other rent-bearing state. `[DECIDE]` | Needs a note that fees are paid by keeper, so owner balance isn't needed for fees. |
| A3 | Keeper holds the nonce authority, so it can close or advance the nonce at will. | Real signers | **Valid, partially accepted.** Withholding/DoS risk, not theft: the beneficiary is fixed in the owner's signed message and re-checked on-chain. Documented as the trust assumption in §2. | Matches execution notes (last open follow-up). `[DECIDE]` |
| A4 | `check_in` doesn't actually invalidate the old presigned transaction on-chain; invalidation depends on the keeper advancing the nonce. | On-chain vs client | **Partly valid.** `check_in` does not touch the nonce, so an old half-signed copy is not invalidated on-chain. It is harmless: the keeper holds the final signature, and the deadline gate uses the updated `last_checkin`, so a stale copy fails the gate. Stored `sweep_tx` is overwritten on every check-in (REQ10); a stale copy fails the deadline gate and only the keeper can submit it (REQ11). | `[DECIDE]` |
| A5 | Live-balance sweep means a compromised owner key near the trigger could drain funds first. | Real signers | **Out of scope.** Key compromise of the owner defeats any non-custodial scheme; disclosed in LOI. | `[DECIDE]` |
| A6 | `Plan` PDA seeded only by owner allows one plan per owner; blocks multiple beneficiaries/plans. | State ownership | **Accepted as MVP limit.** Multi-beneficiary is roadmap. | `[DECIDE]` |
| A7 | UC3 "contains two instructions" violates 1 use case = 1 handler. | Atomicity | **Rejected.** `AdvanceNonceAccount` is a required System Program companion for durable-nonce transactions, not an Heirloom state transition. Only `heir_sweep` is ours. | This is the clearest AI suggestion to override; good candidate for the individual reflection. `[DECIDE]` |
| A8 | Storing a signed transaction publicly on-chain leaks it; shouldn't it be encrypted? | State ownership / Real signers | **Rejected.** The transaction is missing the keeper's required signature, so it cannot be submitted or used to burn the nonce by anyone else. Encryption would add cost and a key to manage for no gain. Residual: it reveals the beneficiary pubkey, which the plan already exposes. | `[DECIDE]` |

## 5.1 Alternate flows and failure paths

| Case | Where it shows | Outcome |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Early submission by someone holding the owner-signed bytes | Missing keeper signature | Rejected at signature verification; nonce **not** advanced |
| Keeper submits before deadline (bug or compromised key) | V1 | Revert, and the nonce **is** advanced (the POC fragility). Prevented by the keeper's own pre-flight (REQ11); no third party can cause this. Residual risk is the keeper trust assumption (§2) |
| Owner checks in after warning period | UC2 | `last_checkin` updated; owner signs a new partial sweep and `check_in` overwrites `sweep_tx`; old copy obsolete |
| Second sweep attempt | V3 | `AlreadyDistributed` |
| Wrong beneficiary / nonce / keeper | V2 | Revert |
| Owner cancels plan | UC4 | `Plan` PDA closed, `sweep_tx` deleted; keeper burns and withdraws the nonce (REQ14), so stale bytes are cryptographically dead. Until the keeper does so, they are still inert (no plan, no keeper signature) |
| Keeper offline when owner cancels | UC4 | Cancel still succeeds. Nonce burn is delayed until keeper returns; meanwhile stale bytes cannot run. Re-initialising needs a new nonce account anyway |
| Owner changes interval/grace | UC5 | Timer restarts from now with new period; new partial sweep replaces the old one |
| Owner updates or closes after `Distributed` | UC4 / UC5 | `close_plan` allowed (reclaims rent); `update_plan` rejected (status != Active) |

## 5.2 External dependencies

System Program (nonce + transfer), Clock sysvar, Solana RPC for the keeper, keeper infrastructure and its signing key (HSM/KMS planned), (the half-signed transaction lives in the `Plan` PDA, so no separate storage).
